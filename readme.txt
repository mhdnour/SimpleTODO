 SimpleTODO:

As the name of my app it's so simple ToDo using WPF (.Net 4.0) 
No complex steps or categories just enter the text of your task then hit Enter
You can add star to your todo (important), select multiColor

What's new in  V3.0:

- Improved the UI (all new design).
- Improved the performance (run and close faster than before after removing some Libraries).
- Now you can remove all tasks and/or done tasks (from settings).
- Remove one task.
